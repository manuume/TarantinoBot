While the place isn't jammed,\\nthere's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching\\non bacon and eating eggs.\\nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The\\nYoung Man has a slight working-class English accent and,\\nlike his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're\\ngoing out of style.\\nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or\\nhow old she is; everything she does contradicts something\\nshe did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is\\nto be said in a rapid pace \\\"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\\\" fashion.\\nThe boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in\\nthere, back and forth.\\nA WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.\\nThe Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man\\nlights up another cigarette.\\nThe Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his\\nsmoke.\\nThe Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her\\ncoffee.\\nThe Young Man goes right back into it.\\nHe calls to the Waitress.\\nThen looks to his girl.\\nThe Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.\\nShe splits.\\nThe Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man\\ncontinues in a low voice.\\nThe Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new\\ninformation.\\nShe sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The\\ntired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the\\nmotions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the\\nCOOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's\\nface.\\nThey both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on\\nthe table. He looks at her and she back at him.\\nAnd with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,\\nstand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona\\nis that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is\\nthat of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG MAN\\n    No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG WOMAN\\n    You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG MAN\\n    I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG WOMAN\\n    but you forget about it in a day or two -\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG MAN\\n    yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG WOMAN\\n    When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG MAN\\n    I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.\\n\\n\\n    YOUNG WOMAN\\n    You sound like a duck.
